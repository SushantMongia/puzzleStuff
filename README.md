Interview Coding 


# Run from commandline.

Step 1: python puzzleSol.py
Step 2: Enter the filename.csv

Make sure to include /path/to/sampledata.csv  in case they're not in the same directory



# Question
Write a program which will process the data listed below. The data must be placed into a csv file and read from it. The first variable is the target price and the following data values are menu items you could buy. The program should then find a combination of dishes that has a total of exactly the target price. If there is no solution if found, then the program should print that there is no combination of dishes that is equal to the target price. The program must run with different data files, so provide instructions on how to run the program from command line with the correct file. Use any programming language to solve this puzzle as long as it can be ran from linux command line. 
Here are some sample data values:
